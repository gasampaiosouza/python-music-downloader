## Why?

It's a bad feeling when you **need** to download **a bunch** of musics you **love**, but you have no time, isn't it?

So, thinking this way, i made this **music downloader**! it is as easy as it seems.

## Usage

To use it is pretty simple!

First of all, just clone this repository and go inside the created folder:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gasampaiosouza/python-music-downloader
    cd python-music-downloader
    ```

Inside `songs.py` you have a list called `SONGS_LIST`, that's where you're going to put your songs.

`SONGS_LIST` is a list with all the URLS after `yt.com/watch?v=`,

> this url regex if you need: `/\?v=(.*)/`

### Examples

### URL Example

- **Full URL**: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9RePc`

- **Valid way**: `68ugkg9RePc`

### Code Examples

```python
# valid list example
SONGS_LIST = ['8mCCMhuKEYw', 'PMivT7MJ41M', 'bnVUHWCynig']

# obs: there's no length limit.
```

## Installation

Everything you need to install is [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#downloading-python-bindings-for-selenium) with `python -m pip install selenium` or just `pip install selenium`.

## Made With

- Python - [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)

## Thank you

That's my project, i hope you liked it, there's a bunch more coming! üíú
